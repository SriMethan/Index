            <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to display documents in a web browser. 
               First developed by Tim Berners Lee in 1990 while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), HTML was one of the key innovative technologies used to publish the worldâ€™s first website on August 6, 1991. 
               Thanks to a restoration project by CERN, you can now revisit the original website. Since that time, HTML has been significantly updated and expanded but its basic purpose to format and structure web pages remains the same.
               Today, HTML is one of many tools used to build the web. Knowing how to write HTML will provide a strong foundation for your career as a web designer and prepare you to learn additional front-end web development skills like CSS and JavaScript.
